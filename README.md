A simple front-end HTML Web Page for a On-line Car Shop
I made a very simple responsive web page using HTML and CSS and a little JavaScript code.
I will continue to make it better and I will appreciate any help.
Next step is to add Some Icons instead of text links in the footer.
Any other recommendations will be welcome.

There are:
1- HTML file
2- CSS file
3- Javascript file
4- Image folder
